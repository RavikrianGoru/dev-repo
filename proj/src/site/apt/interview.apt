What will happer when you run >java Test?
-----------------------------------------
	1) JVM starts
	2) JVM creates & starts main thread
	3) main thread loads Test.class
	4) Main thread executes public static void main(String... args) of Test calls if available
			if not it will executes main method of its parent class
	5) Unloads Test.class
	6) Terminates Main thread
	7) Shoutdown JVM

main mehtod:Allows final strictfp synchronized

	public static void main(String... args)
	public static final strictfp synchronized void main(String... args)
	

Diff b/w new and netInstance():
-------------------------------

new 
	- operator, used to create object/instance of a class
	- if we know class at begining then it can be used.
	- if no corresponding .class then NoClassDefFoundError at run time.

newInstance()
	- is a method in Class.class used to create an object/instanct by passing Class name at runtime
	- Object obj = Class.forName("java.lang.String").newInstance();
	- if .class not available at runtime throws ClassNotFoundException

Diff between NoClassDefFoundError and ClassNotFoundException
-----------------------------------------------------------

NoClassDefFoundError
	- Unchecked Exception
	- Test t = new Test(); if Test.class is not available at runtime.
	- Class Name hardcoded in program
ClassNotFoundException
	- Checked Exception
	- Object obj = Class.forName("Test").netInstance(); if Test.class is not available at runtime.
	- Class Name is passed dynamically




Diff bewteen instanceof and isInstsnce:
---------------------------------------
instanceof"
	- operator, used to check given object is particular type or not.
	- String s = "Ravi"
		if (s instsnceof String || s instanceof Object)
			System.out.print("Hi");
isInstance:
	- isInstance() method , Available in Class.clss used to check the given object is of particular type or not. Type is available at runtime.
	- 

OOPS?

Can we overload main method or static method? Yes.

Can we override the static method or main method? No

Constructor returns a value but, what ?
yes, that is current class instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).

Can we create a program without main method ?
Yes, one of the way is static block but in previous version of JDK not in JDK 1.7.
	In JDK7 and above, output will be:
	Output:Error: Main method not found in class A3, please define the main method as:
	public static void main(String[] args)

What are the 6 ways to use this keyword ?

Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java ?
To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
Diamond problem?

Why use aggregation(has-a relation) ?: code reusability

When use Aggregation?
Code reuse is also best achieved by aggregation when there is no is-a relationship.
Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved; otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.




What is covariant return type ?
since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its return type to subclass type.

What are the three usage of super keyword?
Why use instance initializer block?

What is the usage of blank final variable ?
A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable.

Is final method inherited?
Yes, final method is inherited but you cannot override it.

Can we initialize blank final variable?
Yes, but only in constructor. For example:
*A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable. It can be initialized only in static block.

Can we declare a constructor final?
No, because constructor is never inherited.

What is marker or tagged interface ?

What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch ?
What is the difference between static and dynamic binding ?
How downcasting is possible in java ?
What is the purpose of private constructor?
What is object cloning ?

Advantage of OOPs

How many ways we can create an object?

There are five different ways to create an object in Java,

1. Using new keyword → constructor get called

Employee emp1 = new Employee();
2. Using newInstance() method of Class → constructor get called

Employee emp2 = (Employee) Class.forName("org.programming.mitra.exercises.Employee")
                                .newInstance();
It can also be written as

Employee emp2 = Employee.class.newInstance();
3. Using newInstance() method of Constructor → constructor get called

Constructor<Employee> constructor = Employee.class.getConstructor();
Employee emp3 = constructor.newInstance();
4. Using clone() method → no constructor call

Employee emp4 = (Employee) emp3.clone();
5. Using deserialization → no constructor call

ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.obj"));
Employee emp5 = (Employee) in.readObject();

* What are the different ways to create an object in Java?
	1) By new keyword
	2) By clone() method
	3) By deserialization
	
	*) By newInstance() method--Class.forName("ClassName").newInstance()----it internally uses new key word.
	*) By factory method etc----it internally uses new key word.
* Actually, 3 ways to create objects.(new keyword, clone() and deserialization).


Why String is immutable in java?
	1) String pool is possible as String is immutable. it saves a lot of heap memory.
	2) Security threats: if String is not immutable. Socket programming(host and port) and to get DB connection(username and pwd) as Strings. Sice String is immutable value can not be changed.
	3) Thread-safety: As String is immutable it can be shared across thread without any synchronization.
	4) String are used in classloaders, no one change the calss name as String is immutable.
	5) String is immutable and hashcode is generated at the time of String creation.There is no need to calculate hash code again.
	   String type the best suitable type for key in HashMap.
String pool?	 	



OOPS concepts?
Polymorphism- Method overloading and overridig?
what is synchronization? where and why we use it?
Dynamic binding
	When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding. 

Life cycle of thread?
What is theread sheduler? preemptive or time slicing scheduling

when we get IllegalThreadStateException?
join() method?
public void join()throws InterruptedException
public void join(long milliseconds)throws InterruptedException

Thread pool? how cn we create thread pool?
java.util.concurrent.Executors;
java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;

diff sleep() or wait()?

what is immutable class and how to create it?

peek and pool methods in  Queue?

Java 1.7 features?
JVM, JDK and JRE?


1)will finally block executes after exit, break, return.
A)finally executes in all senarios except exit which causes JVM failure/terminating the process. Also at power shutdown finally/OS failover wont executes.

Singleton:

1) What is Singleton class? Have you used Singleton before?
	
2) Which classes are candidates of Singleton? Which kind of class do you make Singleton in Java?

3) Can you write code for getInstance() method of a Singleton class in Java?
	public static synchronized  Singleton getInstance()
	{
		return new Singleton();
	}
	
	or
	
	private volatile static Singleton _instance;//volatile is recommended
	public static Singleton getInstance()
	{
		if(_instance==null)//Singe-check: get rid of half intitialization issue
		{
			sychronized(Singleton.class)
			{
				if(_instance==null)//Double-check
				{
					return new Singleton();
				}
				return _instance;
			}
		}
		return _instance;
	}	
	
4) Is it better to make whole getInstance() method synchronized or just critical section is enough? Which one you will prefer?

5) What is lazy and early loading of Singleton and how will you implement it?

6) Give me some examples of Singleton pattern from Java Development Kit?
	Runtime.java
	
7) What is double checked locking in Singleton?
	See above
8) It is recommended to used synchronized block then synchronized method due to cost expensive.
	
9) How do you prevent for creating another instance of Singleton using clone() method?
	Dont implement Clonable interface or Override clone method and return same obj/ throw Exception.
10) How do you prevent for creating another instance of Singleton using reflection?
	private cunstructor can be called by using reflection. we throw Exception in constructor or return same obj.

11) How do you prevent for creating another instance of Singleton during serialization?
	You can prevent this by using readResolve() method, since during deserialization readObject() is used to create instance and 
	it return new instance every time but by using readResolve you can replace it with original Singleton instance.
