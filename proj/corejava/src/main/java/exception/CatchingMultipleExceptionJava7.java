package exception;
/*

In Java 7 it was made possible to catch multiple different exceptions in the same catch block. 
This is also known as multi catch.

Sample code:

try 
{
    // execute code that may throw 1 of the 3 exceptions below.
} catch(SQLException | IOException e) {
	// some code
} catch(Exception e) {
	// some code
}
