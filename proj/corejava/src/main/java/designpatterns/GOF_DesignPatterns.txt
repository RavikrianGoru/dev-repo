	2. Structural design patterns
	3. Behavioral design patterns



Creational design patterns
--------------------------
I. Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate an object in the best possible way for specific situations.
   The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add unwanted complexity to the design.
   Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation by different ways.
   
    1) Singleton
    2) Factory
    3) Abstract Factory 
    4) Builder
    5) Prototype
All these patterns solve specific problems with object creation, so we should understand and use them when needed.
